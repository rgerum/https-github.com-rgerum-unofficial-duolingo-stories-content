~ Introduction

[LINE]
Speaker40: Еттык, and welcome to Chukchi stories for English speakers!
~            hello

[LINE]
Speaker40: Моргынан will take a look at a few things you should know about Chukchi that will affect these stories!.
~          We

Speaker40: Лыгъоравэтльэн~Йилыйил is a language spoken by around 5000 people in the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug in far Northeastern Siberia. You can see Alaska from there! The language is endangered, with most speakers being over the age of 20.
~            Chukchi 

[LINE]
Speaker40: However, with increasing use of the internet, this can change, starting with small things like Duolingo-style stories in Chukchi.   

[LINE]
Speaker40: Anyways, subject pronouns aren't always required, though they can still be helpful for beginners.       

[LINE]
Speaker414: Гым тынымытваркын Чукоткак.
~           I I~live in~Chukotka  

[LINE]
Speaker414: Тынымытваркын Чукоткак.   
~           I~live in~Chukotka  

[LINE]
Speaker40: Also, there are no articles in Chukchi. That means there are no words for "the" or "a". 

[LINE]
Speaker414: Тыкгы  
~           Can~be~either~"a~seal"~or~"the~seal" 

[LINE]
Speaker40: As you have seen with the sentences so far, Chukchi is an agglutinative language. Parts of words are "glued" together to make some *very* long words!

[LINE]
Speaker414: Мури мытан'к'ычоркмыкан'онан'аткоморэ.  
~           we we~walk~along~the~sea~with~staffs

[LINE]
Speaker40: Phew, what a mouthful! Also, Chukchi uses the Cyrillic Alphabet with three additions: Ӈ ӈ, Ӄ ӄ, and Ԓ ԓ. Outside of academic contexts, these are written as Н' н', К' к', and Л л respectively.

[LINE]
Speaker40: Н' н' is the ng sound in "song" or "wing", but it can also occur at the beginning of syllables too.

[LINE]
Speaker414: Ан'к'ы, н'ирек'  
~           sea two

[LINE]
Speaker40: К' к' is a q sound that doesn't have an English equivalent. Arabic uses the same sound transliterated as q.

[LINE]
Speaker414: Илылк'ын, к’ынур
~ marsh as~if

[LINE]
Speaker40: Don't confuse Russian Л л with Chukchi Л л! Though they are written the same, Chukchi Л л is pronounced like the Welsh ll.

[LINE]
Speaker414: Лыплып, гилгил
~ mountain~pass egg

[LINE]
Speaker40: Finally, there are two other letters that are pronounced differently: Г г and В в. Г г has no English equivalent, but can be thought of as a fricative g. В в is somewhere between b and v.

Speaker414: Гытгын, вытвыт
~           lake flower      

[LINE]
Speaker40: That's all for me for now. I hope you have fun learning Chukchi! Let's jump right in! 

[LINE]
Speaker414: Мынэквэт!
