Speaker0: Welcome to the unofficial Duolingo Stories course for Tok Pisin!

[LINE]
Speaker0: Tok Pisin is one of the official languages of Papua New Guinea spoken by around five to six million people, though not everyone is fluent. Around one million people use the language as a primary language, and that number is growing.

[LINE]
Speaker0: The language developed as a result of slaves and indentured servants from lots of different places around the Pacific being brought to Australia. Forced to work in the Queensland Plantations, laborers began to develop a pidgin language from the English that the plantation owners were speaking so they could communicate with each other. Therefore, the pidgin took aspects mostly from English, but it also incorporates German, Malay, Portuguese, and other Austronesian languages.

[LINE]
Speaker0: When the laborers went home to Papua New Guinea (and the Solomon Islands/Vanuatu too!) they brought their language with them, taught it to their children, and used it for all aspects of life. This process is called creolization and caused the language to become a fully-fledged creole, though it kept the name Pisin (Pidgin). The Solomon Islands and Vanuatu versions of Pisin diverged from Tok Pisin, yet they are still currently mutually intelligible with them. 

[LINE]
Speaker0: As there are 800+ different languages in Papua New Guinea, the growing knowledge and fluency of Tok Pisin over the Pacific meant that different tribes that previously spoke different languages and were hostile to each other now had a common language and are able to communicate.

[LINE]
Speaker0: In the modern day, Tok Pisin is widely spoken and understood especially in the city, though rural/remote areas of Tok Pisin may still be using their local indigenous language.

Speaker0: Even though a lot of words in Tok Pisin are taken from English, don't expect that all words will have the same meaning like in English! There are certainly a lot of Tok Pisin words from English that have the same definition as in English, however there are others with different shades of meanings, or even completely different ones! Here is an example.

Speaker40: Hamas krismas yu gat?
~ how~much,~how~many year,~Christmas you have

[LINE]
Speaker0: Did you catch that? "Krismas" can mean both "Christmas" and "year", and "hamas krismas yu gat" (literally "how many Christmases do you have") means "how old are you"!
