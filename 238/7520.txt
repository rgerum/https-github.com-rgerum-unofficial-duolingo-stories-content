Speaker0: Welcome to the unofficial Duolingo Stories course for Tok Pisin!

[LINE]
Speaker0: Tok Pisin is one of the official languages of Papua New Guinea spoken by around five to six million people, though not everyone is fluent. Around one million people use the language as a primary language, and that number is growing.

[LINE]
Speaker0: The language developed as a result of slaves and indentured servants from lots of different places around the Pacific being brought to Australia. Forced to work in the Queensland Plantations, laborers began to develop a pidgin language from the English that the plantation owners were speaking so they could communicate with each other. Therefore, the pidgin took aspects mostly from English, but it also incorporates German, Malay, Portuguese, and other Austronesian languages.

[LINE]
Speaker0: When the laborers went home to Papua New Guinea (and the Solomon Islands/Vanuatu too!) they brought their language with them, taught it to their children, and used it for all aspects of life. This process is called creolization and caused the language to become a fully-fledged creole, though it kept the name Pisin (Pidgin). The Solomon Islands and Vanuatu versions of Pisin diverged from Tok Pisin, yet they are still currently mutually intelligible with them. 

[LINE]
Speaker0: As there are 800+ different languages in Papua New Guinea, the growing knowledge and fluency of Tok Pisin over the Pacific meant that different tribes that previously spoke different languages and were hostile to each other now had a common language and are able to communicate.

[LINE]
Speaker0: In the modern day, Tok Pisin is widely spoken and understood especially in the city, though rural/remote areas of Tok Pisin may still be using their local indigenous language.

[LINE]
Speaker0: The Tok Pisin spoken in the cities are now also influenced by English, since English is the language of education in Papua New Guinea. Therefore, codeswitching and loanwords from English may be common.

[LINE]
Speaker0: This course will be teaching a type of Tok Pisin without heavy influences of loanwords. While this variety may be considered primitive or old-fashioned in modern day Papua New Guinea, learning a "purer" Tok Pisin builds a basis for you to choose whether to read the Bible in Tok Pisin (which would not have a lot of English loanwords) or to interact with people from Papua New Guinea (which would have a lot of English influence).

[LINE]
Speaker0: Hopefully this gives you a better idea of what Tok Pisin is and inspires you perhaps to learn Tok Pisin!
