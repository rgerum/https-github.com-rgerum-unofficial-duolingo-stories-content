Speaker0: Welcome to the unofficial Duolingo Stories course for Tok Pisin!

[LINE]
Speaker0: Tok Pisin is one of the official languages of Papua New Guinea spoken by around five to six million people, though not everyone is fluent. Around one million people use the language as a primary language, and that number is growing.

[LINE]
Speaker0: The language developed as a result of slaves and indentured servants from lots of different places around the Pacific being brought to Australia. Forced to work in the Queensland Plantations, laborers began to develop a pidgin language so they could communicate with each other. The pidgin took aspects mostly from English, but it also incorporates German, Malay, Portuguese, and other Austronesian languages.
