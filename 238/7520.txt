Speaker0: Welcome to the unofficial Duolingo Stories course for Tok Pisin!

[LINE]
Speaker0: Tok Pisin is one of the official languages of Papua New Guinea spoken by around five to six million people, though not everyone is fluent. Around one million people use the language as a primary language, and that number is growing.

[LINE]
Speaker0: The language developed as a result of slaves and indentured servants from lots of different places around the Pacific being brought to Australia. Forced to work in the Queensland Plantations, laborers began to develop a pidgin language from the English that the plantation owners were speaking so they could communicate with each other. Therefore, the pidgin took aspects mostly from English, but it also incorporates German, Malay, Portuguese, and other Austronesian languages.

[LINE]
Speaker0: Even though a lot of words in Tok Pisin are taken from English, don't expect that all words will have the same meaning like in English! There are certainly a lot of Tok Pisin words from English that have the same definition as in English, however there are others with different shades of meanings, or even completely different ones! Here are some examples.
