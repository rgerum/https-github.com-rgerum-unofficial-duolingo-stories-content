Speaker0: Did you notice that Norwegian uses a gender-neutral word for a ‘significant other’?

Speaker0: Some Norwegians, if they need to be more specific, will use words explicitly stating the gender of the  significant other...

[LINE]
Speaker0: But that happens very rarely, can sound a bit unnatural (like saying ‘male...’ or ‘female significant other’ would in English) and is usually avoided in favour of context intofmation (like gendered personal pronouns used to refer to the person in question).
