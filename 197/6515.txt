> Some basic grammar.

[LINE]
> Nynorsk is known for having 3 genders, a verb system that's more complex compared to bokmål, and all its a- and ar-endings.
[LINE]
Speaker416: The three genders work as follow. We have masculine (hankjønn), feminine (hokjønn), and neuter (inkjekjønn). Masculine gets the pronoun han, feminine ho, and neuter det. Almost all adjectives are only distinguished in the neuter.

> Masculine (hankjønn).

> Feminine (hokjønn)
[LINE]
Speaker416: Then you have the feminine. Here one traditionally has weak (svak) and strong (sterk) declension. The weak ones simply end in -e and change their vowel, this class includes hytte, kvinne, gryte.

[LINE]
> Neuter (inkjekjønn)
[LINE]
Speaker416: Then lastly, the neuter gender. Pretty much all neuter nouns follow the same pattern. They do not get an ending in the plural, and they are often one syllable, and also a lot end with an -e, such as møte or ynskje.
