> What is nynorsk?

[LINE]
> What is the history?

[LINE]
Speaker44: Nynorsk started as a written language in the 1800s. After writing Danish for centuries, people wanted to write Norwegian again. 

[LINE]
Speaker44: Ivar Aasen spent years collecting the surviving dialects, and made a grammar and dictionary with what he collected.
[LINE]
Speaker44: Whilst bokmål is a descendant of the written Dano-Norwegian that came from the union between Denmark and Norway, nynorsk is based in the dialects. Traditionally people only wrote bokmål in the cities.

[LINE]
> What about today?

[LINE]
Speaker416: Today it is one of the two written forms of the Norwegian language. Nynorsk is official in 2 counties (Møre og Romsdal and Vestland) and 90 municipalities spread across western, southern and eastern Norway.

[LINE]
Speaker416: 11% of pupils have it as their main language, or "hovudmål", and 16% of adults have it as their official language in taxes.

[LINE]
> How does it sound and look like?

[LINE]
Speaker416: Nynorsk is a written language. You might hear some speak it on the news or the radio, or even in theater, but in general it is not intended as a spoken language.

[LINE]
Speaker416: But it looks like this. Compared to bokmål, we love our hard consonants and diphthongs!
[LINE]
Speaker40: Eg heiter Bjørnar. Eg elskar å rekna og kasta steinar!

[LINE]
Speaker416: And of course the ar-endings. In nynorsk a-endings and feminine is also mandatory. Nynorsk always has 3 genders!

[LINE]
Speaker40: Eg såg ei jente i ei hytte for litt sidan, men eg trur eg skremde ho bort!
