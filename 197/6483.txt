> What is the history?

[LINE]
Speaker44: Nynorsk started as a written language in the 1800s. After writing Danish for centuries, people wanted to write Norwegian again.

Speaker44: Whilst bokmål is a descendant of the written Dano-Norwegian that came from the union between Denmark and Norway, nynorsk is based in the dialects. Traditionally people only wrote bokmål in the cities.
