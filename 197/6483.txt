[LINE]
Speaker44: Nynorsk started as a written language in Norway in the 1800s. After writing Danish for centuries, many people wanted to form a new identity once we reached independence. The question of what language we should use, became relevant.

Speaker44: This was called landsmål. Landsmål was used all across the country, and stood strong outside of the cities. Organizations popped up everywhere, that fought for nynorsk.

[LINE]
Speaker416: Today it is one of the two official written forms of the Norwegian language. Nynorsk is official in 2 counties (Møre og Romsdal and Vestland) and 90 municipalities spread across western, southern and eastern Norway.

[LINE]
Speaker416: 11% of pupils have it as their main language, or "hovudmål", and 16% of adults have it as their official language in taxes. Nynorsk organizations such as Noregs Mållag also have thousands of members across the entire country.

> How does it sound and look like?

[LINE]
Speaker416: Nynorsk is a written language. You might hear some speak it on the news or the radio, or even in theater, but in general it is not intended as a spoken language.

[LINE]
Speaker416: But it looks like this. Compared to bokmål, we love our hard consonants and diphthongs!
