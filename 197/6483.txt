> What is nynorsk?

[LINE]
> What is the history of nynorsk?

[LINE]
Speaker44: Nynorsk started as a written language in Norway in the 1800s. After writing Danish for centuries, many people wanted to form a new identity once we reached independence. The question of what language we should use, became relevant. 

[LINE]
Speaker44: One man sought to answer this question. Ivar Aasen; He spent years collecting the surviving dialects across the country, and made a grammar and dictionary with what he collected.

[LINE]
Speaker44: This was called landsmål. Landsmål was used all across the country, and stood strong outside of the cities. Organizations popped up everywhere, that fought for nynorsk. 

[LINE]
Speaker44: Through decades of change and language reforms, it eventually evolved into the nynorsk we have today.

[LINE]
> How are things today?

[LINE]
Speaker416: Today it is one of the two official written forms of the Norwegian language. Nynorsk is official in 2 counties (Møre og Romsdal and Vestland) and 90 municipalities spread across western, southern and eastern Norway.

[LINE]
Speaker416: 11% of pupils have it as their main language, or "hovudmål", and 16% of adults have it as their official language in taxes.

[LINE]
> How does it sound and look like?

[LINE]
Speaker416: Nynorsk is a written language. You might hear some speak it on the news or the radio, or even in theater, but in general it is not intended as a spoken language.

[LINE]
Speaker416: But it looks like this. Compared to bokmål, we love our hard consonants and diphthongs!

[LINE]
Speaker416: And of course the ar-endings. In nynorsk a-endings and feminine is also mandatory. Nynorsk always has 3 genders!

Speaker40: Eg såg ei jente i ei hytte for litt sidan, men eg trur eg skremde ho bort!

[LINE]
> Some basic grammar.

[LINE]
Speaker416: The three genders work as follow. We have masculine (hankjønn), feminine (hokjønn), and neuter (inkjekjønn). Masculine gets the pronoun han, feminine ho, and neuter det. Almost all adjectives are only distinguished in the neuter.

[LINE]
Speaker416: You have masculine (hankjønn).

[LINE]
Speaker416: Then you have the feminine (hokjønn). Here one traditionally has weak (svak) and strong (sterk) declension. The weak ones simply end in -e and change their vowel, this class includes hytte, kvinne, gryte.

Speaker416: Sterk~bøying:

[LINE]
Speaker416: Then lastly, the neuter gender (inkjekjønn). Today, only 3 words can have the weak declension: Auga, hjarta, øyra, though a lot of neuter nouns do end in -e, such as møte or ynskje.

Speaker44: If you plan to go to western Norway, especially the countryside, it can be a good idea to know some nynorsk! You also get access to a lot of the rich literary history of nynorsk, as well as getting a deeper understanding of how Norwegian works!
