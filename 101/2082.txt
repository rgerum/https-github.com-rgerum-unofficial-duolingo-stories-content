[LINE]
> In the previous lessons, you were introduced to the Tamil vowels and consonants. In this lesson, you will learn how these two sets of letters can be combined to form new syllables.

[LINE]
> There are 12 vowels (excluding ak) and 18 consonants. This means 216 unique syllables can be produced (12 x 18). Including the vowels and consonants, there are 246 individual letters (excluding ak). 

[LINE]
> Don't be intimidated by this number. You only really need to memorize the vowels and consonants (and their respective diacritics). You'll understand why, as we go along.

[LINE]
> In order to create a "vowel-consonant" syllable, you simply take the pure consonant and make a small change or mark (diacritic). Take a look at the following example.

[LINE]
Speaker592: க் + அ, க.
~           k  ~ a   ka

[LINE]
> When combining a consonant with the vowel ah, you simply remove the dot from above the consonant. Recall that the dot is the defining feature of Tamil consonants.

[LINE]
> Let's look at the rest of the diacritics. Repeat after Oscar to practice your pronunciation.

[LINE]
> If you memorize these diacritics, you can apply them to any consonant to create a vowel-consonant letter. In other words, the diacritics work the same way for every letter. The only exception to this rule is when combining with u and oo. You will have to memorize those letters individually. They are listed below.
