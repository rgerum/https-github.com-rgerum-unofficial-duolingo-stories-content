[LINE]
> In the last lesson, you learned the vowels of the Tamil language. In this lesson, we will delve into the consonants. Listed below are the 18 consonants in order.

[LINE]
> Note that the following are pure consonants. This means they represent the consonant sound alone. However, since lone consonant sounds are not particularly easy to pronounce, we add a short "i" sound before each consonant. For example, க் is not pronounced as "k," but as "ik." You'll get the hang of this as we go along.

> The following letter is unique to Tamil and Malayalam, and is considered by some to be the hardest sound for non-native Tamil speakers to pronounce. It is similar to the "r" in American English (e.g. red).

> You may have noticed that all the above consonants have a dot above them. In fact, this is what distinguishes them from other letters in Tamil. So, if you see a letter you don't recognize, at least you'll know whether or not it is a consonant.
