Speaker343: Asturian (also known as Bable) is a West Romance language, spoken mainly in the region of Asturias, Spain, but also in the region of Leon (where it recieves the name of Leonese) and in the Portuguese region of Miranda do Douro (where it recieves the name of Mirandese). It's usually known by linguists as "Asturleonse", but not by speakers.

Speaker343: Asturian is an endargered language, that's been in decline since the 19th century, being replaced by Spanish. During the Francoist dictatorship in Spain, the language was forbidden and penalized in many spaces. After the democratization of Spain, the local goverment of Asturias has tried to revitalize the language by promoting it in schools, which has worked: In 2000, only 1/3 of Asturians spoke Asturian, in 2017 61% did. Although no efforts have been made in Leon, where the language is declining and it's probable that it'll be extinct in the coming years.

Speaker343: It doesn't have an official status in any Spanish region, but it has co-oficial status in Miranda do Douro, Portugal.

Speaker343: As a romance language, it is very similar to other neighboring romance languages like Spanish or Galician. It is the only Romance language that keeps the neuter gender from Latin, which can be seen in adjetives with the ending -o.
