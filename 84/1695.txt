> In the last lesson, you learned all about vowels in the Telugu language. In today's lesson we will cover consonants! In Telugu there is an important distinction between aspirated and unaspirated, aspirated basically means letting out an extra puff of air while saying the consonant. Telugu consonants are traditionally divided into six sections: velar, palatal, retroflex, alveolar, and miscellaneous. When you learn consonants it is assumed to end with an 'a', if it does not we shall add special markings.
