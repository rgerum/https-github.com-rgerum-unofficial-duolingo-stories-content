~ Thaana letters

Speaker258: Welcome to the Duostories Dhivehi course! 

[LINE]
Speaker258: In this beginning lesson, I will teach you how to read Dhivehi. You should probably write this down.

[LINE]
Speaker258: If you didn't know, the Dhivehi alphabet, Thaana, is written from right to left. This is the opposite of the Latin alphabet. Try not to read it left to right.

[LINE]
Speaker258: !ދިވެހި ދަސްކުރާށެވެ
~            Dhivehi learn! 

[LINE]
Speaker258: In the sentence above, the first word is "ދިވެހި", and not "!ދަސްކުރާށެވެ" 

[MULTIPLE_CHOICE]
> ދިވެއްސަކީ ވަރަށް އުނދަގޫ ބަހެއް ނޫނެވެ.
~ Dhivehi~is very difficult a~language not
+ "ދިވެއްސަކީ" is the first word
- "ނޫނެވެ" is the first word

[LINE]
Speaker258: The first letter of the Thaana alphabet is...

[LINE]
Speaker258: ހ
~ H

[LINE]
Speaker258: "Haa". It makes the "h" sound. Simple, right? Alright, here's the rest of them.

[LINE]
Speaker258: ހ ށ ނ ރ ބ ޅ ކ އ ވ މ ފ ދ ތ ލ ގ ޏ ސ ޑ ޒ ޓ ޔ ޕ ޖ ޗ
~ H SH N R B LH K Vowel~carrier V/W M F DH TH L G NY S D Z T Y P J~(Like~english) CH

[LINE]
Speaker258:Now, for the vowels. Dhivehi words are written in syllables. So, the word "Dhivehi" would be spelled Dhi Ve Hi (but still as one whole word) ދި ވެ ހި . So the word Dhivehi is "ދިވެހި".

[LINE]
Speaker258:There are short and long vowel sounds. For example, if you see "Ka (ކަ)" it'll just be a short "a" sound, like in "cup". However, if you see a long vowel sound like "Kaa (ކާ)" it'll be a long "a" sound, like in "father". As you can see, vowels are like just like diacritics. Usually we write the vowel symbol twice to make a vowel long, but there are a few exceptions. Here are all the vowel symbols, using K (ކ) as an example:

[LINE]
Speaker258:ކަ ކާ ކި ކީ ކު ކޫ ކެ ކޭ ކޮ ކޯ ކް
~Ka Kaa Ki Kee Ku Koo Ke Kei Ko Koa K

[LINE]
Speaker258:Also, to put a vowel as the start of a syllable, we use the vowel carrier "އ" like in "އަސް", pronounced "As ("A" as in "cup", "s" as in "sand")"

Speaker258:Now, let's do a little test to see how well you can do.

[POINT_TO_PHRASE]
> Choose the option that says "Bodu"
Speaker258: (+ބޮޑު) އަކީ (ކުޑައިގެ) (އިދިކޮޅެވެ)
~            big is of~small opposite

[LINE]
Speaker258:Well, I think you're set to go! I wish you good luck on the stories ahead!

[LINE]
Speaker258:Although, let's just do one more test just to make sure. 

[MULTIPLE_CHOICE]
> The word "ބުޅާ" transliterated would be:
- sukaa
+ bulhaa
- setaa
