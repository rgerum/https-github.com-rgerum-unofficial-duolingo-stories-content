Speaker0: Welcome to the unofficial Toki Pona Duolingo Stories in sitelen pona!

[LINE]
Speaker0: Ever since its creation in 2001, people have come up with, and continue to come up with, creative ways to write Toki Pona. The minimalist set of vocabulary, and the simple phonology, syllables, and general ponotactics, lend themselves to being adapted to various existing writing systems. On top of that, new writing systems have been created.

[LINE]
Speaker0: When Sonja Lang wrote "Toki Pona: The Language of Good" she included her own writing system: sitelen pona. Today, it is the most used writing system for Toki Pona after Latin script, and many prefer it over Latin script or find it easier to read and write.

[LINE]
Speaker0: This course will present you stories translated into Toki Pona, rendered in the sitelen pona writing system. Let's go over the basics!

[LINE]
Speaker0: sitelen pona is a "logographic writing system". This means that each word is represented by one symbol.

[LINE]
Speaker0: With only 120-ish words, you won't have to remember that many of them. Here are the words that appear in the first official Toki Pona book:

[LINE]

[LINE]
Speaker0: In addition to having only relatively few words and symbols to remember, each symbol tends to represent a part of what the glyph can mean. For example:

[LINE]
Speaker40: alasa

[LINE]
Speaker0: "alasa" can be described as the concept around "to hunt, to gather, to search". One form of "hunting" can be done with a bow and arrow, so the symbol "alasa" is a simplified bow and arrow.

[LINE]
Speaker40: kala

[LINE]
Speaker0: Fishes, but also any kind of aquatic creature, are best described in toki pona as "kala". A simplified drawing of a fish is used for the word "kala" in sitelen pona.

[LINE]
Speaker0: Because proper names don't have symbols that are widely understood,
