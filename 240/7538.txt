Speaker0: Ever since its creation in 2001, people have come up with, and continue to come up with, creative ways to write Toki Pona.

On top of that, new writing systems have been created.

Speaker0: When Sonja Lang wrote "Toki Pona: The Language of Good" she included her own writing system: sitelen pona. Today, it is the most used writing system for Toki Pona after Latin script, and many prefer it over Latin script or find it easier to read and write.
