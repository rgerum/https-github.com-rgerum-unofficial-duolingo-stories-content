Speaker0: Welcome to the unofficial Toki Pona Duolingo Stories in sitelen pona!

[LINE]
Speaker0: Ever since its creation in 2001, people have come up with, and continue to come up with, creative ways to write Toki Pona. The minimalist set of vocabulary, and the simple phonology, syllables, and general ponotactics, lend themselves to being adapted to various existing writing systems. On top of that, new writing systems have been created.

[LINE]
Speaker0: When Sonja Lang wrote "Toki Pona: The Language of Good" she included her own writing system: sitelen pona. Today, it is the most used writing system for Toki Pona after Latin script, and many prefer it over Latin script or find it easier to read and write.

[LINE]
Speaker0: This course will present you stories translated into Toki Pona, rendered in the sitelen pona writing system. Let's go over the basics!

[LINE]
> sitelen pona principles

[LINE]
Speaker0: sitelen pona is a "logographic writing system". This means that each word is represented by one symbol.

[LINE]
Speaker0: With only 120-ish words, you won't have to remember that many of them. Here are the words (and glyphs) that appear in the first official Toki Pona book:

[LINE]
Speaker40: a akesi ala alasa ale anpa ante anu awen e en esun ijo ike ilo insa jaki jan jelo jo kala kalama kama kasi ken kepeken kili kiwen ko kon kule kulupu kute la lape laso lawa len lete li lili linja lipu loje lon luka lukin lupa ma mama mani meli mi mije moku moli monsi mu mun musi mute nanpa nasa nasin nena ni nimi noka o olin ona open pakala pali palisa pan pana pi pilin pimeja pini pipi poka poki pona pu sama seli selo seme sewi sijelo sike sin sina sinpin sitelen sona soweli suli suno supa suwi tan taso tawa telo tenpo toki tomo tu unpa uta utala walo wan waso wawa weka wile

[LINE]
Speaker0: In addition to having only relatively few words and symbols to remember, each symbol tends to represent a part of what the glyph can mean. For example:

[LINE]
Speaker40: alasa

[LINE]
Speaker0: "alasa" can be described as the concept around "to hunt, to gather, to search". One form of "hunting" can be done with a bow and arrow, so the symbol "alasa" is a simplified bow and arrow.

[LINE]
Speaker40: kala

[LINE]
Speaker0: Fishes, but also any kind of aquatic creature, are best described in toki pona as "kala". A simplified drawing of a fish is used for the word "kala" in sitelen pona.

[LINE]
> Names

[LINE]
Speaker0: Because proper names don't have symbols that are widely understood, they get written in a particular way. 

[LINE]
Speaker0: Each sound/letter of a name gets written out with any sitelen pona character that sounds with the same sound/letter. The finished name then gets enclosed by a cartouche. Which characters get chosen is up to preference, and can hold personal value. Here is the exact same word written in two different, equally valid ways:

[LINE]
Speaker40: jan [pilin insa telo en]

[LINE]
Speaker40: jan [pona ilo tawa e]

[LINE]
Speaker0: The reading direction in these courses is from left to right.

[LINE]
> combining characters

[LINE]
Speaker0: sitelen pona has one more trick up its sleave! The head of a phrase can be combined with one(!) modifier. (In English terms, this can mean that a noun can be combined with one adjective, or a verb can be combined with one adverb.) in one of two ways:

[LINE]
Speaker0: The modifier can go inside the head of the phrase. For example, in "toki pona", "toki" is the head and "pona" is the modifier:

[LINE]
Speaker40: toki+pona

[LINE]
Speaker0: The modifier can go on top of the head of the phrase. For example, in "kala lili", "kala" is the head and "lili" is the modifier:

[LINE]
Speaker40: kala-lili

[LINE]
Speaker0: So character combinations are read inside-out and bottom-to-top.

[LINE]
> punctuation

[LINE]
Speaker0: In Toki Pona, punctuation is always arbitrary, beyond sentence separation, and serves more of a reading aid. 

[LINE]
Speaker0: In sitelen pona, the characters themselves provide most of this function. For sentence separation, no distinction is made between exclamation marks, question marks or periods. 

[LINE]
Speaker0: Instead, the content of the sentence itself indicates if it's a question, said energetically, or a regular statement:

[LINE]
Speaker40: kon li lete

[LINE]
Speaker0: This sentence is a normal statement.

[LINE]
Speaker40: kon li lete ala lete

[LINE]
Speaker40: kon li lete anu seme

[LINE]
Speaker0: These are 2 ways for the grammar to indicate a yes/no question.

[LINE]
Speaker40: kon li lete a

[LINE]
Speaker0: The word "a" can indicate emotional emphasis, so this sentence is more of an exclamation.

[LINE]
Speaker40: seme li lete

[LINE]
Speaker40: kon li seme

[LINE]
Speaker0: The word "seme" is used to ask about details, so this sentence is a question.

[LINE]
> sentence separation

[LINE]
Speaker0: There is no total agreement how to separate sentences in sitelen pona. The best method is to work with line breaks. In this course, if sentences need to be separated in the same line, we will use an interpunct "Â·" for this purpose.

[LINE]
Speaker40: mi tawa. o awen

[LINE]
> related formatting

[LINE]
Speaker0: There may be additional features of sitelen pona that appear in the lessons.

[LINE]
Speaker0: If there are quotation marks, we will use CJK-style characters to indicate speech:

[LINE]
Speaker40: te toki to

[LINE]
Speaker0: In this course, colons will not be in use. Instead, we rotate the symbol for "ni" to indicate the direction of which sentence gets referred to.

[LINE]
Speaker40: mi lukin e ni>. waso li tawa

[LINE]
Speaker40: waso li tawa. mi lukin e ni<
