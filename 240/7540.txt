Speaker0: sitelen pona has a little trick up its sleave! Under the right conditions, 2 characters can occupy the same space.

[LINE]
Speaker0: The head of a phrase can be combined with one(!) modifier. (In English terms, this can mean that a noun can be combined with one adjective, or a verb can be combined with one adverb.) 

[LINE]
Speaker0: This can happen in one of two ways:

[LINE]
Speaker0: The modifier can go inside the head of the phrase. For example, in "toki pona", "toki" is the head and "pona" is the modifier:

[LINE]
Speaker40: toki+pona

[LINE]
Speaker0: The modifier can go on top of the head of the phrase. For example, in "kala lili", "kala" is the head and "lili" is the modifier:

[LINE]
Speaker40: kala-lili

[LINE]
Speaker0: So character combinations are read inside-out and bottom-to-top.

[LINE]
Speaker0: Character combinations will only be used occasionally in this course.
