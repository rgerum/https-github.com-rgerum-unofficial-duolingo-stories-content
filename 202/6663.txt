Speaker0: Welcome to the Unofficial Viossa Duolingo Stories!

[LINE]
Speaker0: Viossa was originally started in 2014 as a project on Skype between conlangers to see whether they could understand each other without the use of a common language (like English, for example). They decided to only speak languages that they either knew as their native language or fluently. 

[LINE]
Speaker0: And within 48 hours of speaking, gesturing, drawing on whiteboard or paper, etc. — a new language was born!

[LINE]
Speaker0: A year later, Viossa speakers found this concept of teaching & learning a language so unique that they decided to create some fundamental rules for Viossa.

[LINE]
> The Rules of Viossa

[LINE]
Speaker0: No translations. If it's understood, it's Viossa. 

[LINE]
Speaker0: There are 4 words we are able to translate to start you off on your journey!

[LINE]
Speaker40: Akkurat. Nai. Fshto. Ka?
~           yes   no understand what?

[LINE]
Speaker0: Everything else, including vocabulary and grammar, should be learned in Viossa!

[LINE]
Speaker0: If you're interested in learning more, you can watch jan Misali's video on Viossa (https://youtu.be/F1LBCMWDNwo), and join the Viossa Discord server (https://discord.gg/7hdbmvwmc9), where the community actively speaks/writes in the language. The Unofficial Viossa Duolingo Stories should mainly be used as a supplement in learning Viossa!

> Tips & Notes

[LINE]
Speaker0: With all that out of the way, here are some tips and tricks on how these stories will work.
[LINE]
Speaker0: As the Narrator, I will be speaking in a constructed form of a Viossa that is designed to be relatively "neutral" and easy to understand. We do not recommend treating our neutral Viossa as the "standard language". Because of the "if understood, it is Viossa" rule, there is not a single standard version of Viossa. People can be very creative with their own Viossa, and that results in a great diversity of dialects — a point of pride for Viossa speakers.

[LINE]
Speaker0: Therefore, exposure to different dialects is important. To address this, all of the characters in this story will speak in a dialect in dialogues. Each character has been assigned a Viossa speaker, so each time a character comes up, it would be the same speaker every time!

Speaker415: Un hannti na tropos f'un, au anderdžin deki hanu tropos fu hei. Mange bra gid!
~            ~  hanu~-ti ~ ~ fu~un ~  ander~-djin ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ kokoroko~per~koske~glau

[LINE]
Speaker0: Underlined words will show you how compound words can be broken up and how affixes and words are interacting. When someone uses a word that might not be immediately recognizable to everyone, a more "neutral" version may also be provided when you hover over it. Sometimes, it may even show you definitions for words!
~            ~

Speaker0: Each story will feature a variety of comprehension questions in Viossa, so you should stay quick on your feet!
