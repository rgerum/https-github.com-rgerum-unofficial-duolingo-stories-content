Speaker0: Welcome to the Unofficial Viossa Duolingo Stories!

[LINE]
Speaker0: Viossa (from "vi" meaning "we, us" and "glossa" meaning "language") was originally started in 2014 as a project on Skype between conlangers to see whether they could understand each other without the use of a common language (like English, for example). They decided to only speak languages that they either knew as their native language or fluently. 

[LINE]
Speaker0: And within 48 hours of speaking, gesturing, drawing on whiteboard or paper, etc. — a new language was born!

[LINE]
Speaker0: A year later, Viossa speakers found this concept of teaching & learning a language so unique that they decided to create some fundamental rules for Viossa.

[LINE]
Speaker0: No translations. If it's understood, it's Viossa. 

[LINE]
Speaker0: There are 4 words we are able to translate to start you off on your journey!

[LINE]
Speaker40: Akkurat. Nai. Fshto. Ka?
~           yes   no understand what?

[LINE]
Speaker0: Everything else, including vocabulary and grammar, should be learned in Viossa!

[LINE]
Speaker0: If you're interested in learning more, you can watch jan Misali's video on Viossa, and join the Viossa Discord server, where the community actively speaks/writes in the language. The Unofficial Viossa Duolingo Stories should mainly be used as a supplement in learning Viossa!

> Tips & Notes

[LINE]
Speaker0: With all that out of the way, here are some tips and tricks on how these stories will work.
[LINE]
Speaker0: As the Narrator, I will be speaking in a form of Viossa that is considered "neutral" and easy to understand. Dialogue between the characters will feature Viossa of different Viossa speakers, using their own natural way of speaking.

Speaker415: Un hannti na tropos f'un, au anderdžin deki hanu tropos fu hei.
~            ~  hanu~-ti ~ ~ fu~un ~  ander~-djin

[LINE]
Speaker0: Underlined words will show you how compound words break up as well as how affixes and words may interact. When someone uses a word that might not be immediately recognizable to everyone, a more "neutral" version may also be provided when you hover over it! 
~            ~
