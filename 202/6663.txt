Speaker0: Welcome to the Viossa Duolingo Course.

[LINE]
Speaker0: Viossa was originally started in 2014 as a project on Skype between conlangers to see whether they can understand each other without the use of a common language (like English, for example). They decided to only speak languages that they either know as their native language or fluently. 

[LINE]
Speaker0: And within 48 hours of speaking, gesturing, drawing, etc., a new language was born!

[LINE]
Speaker0: A year later, Viossa speakers found this concept of teaching/learning a language so unique that they decided to have some fundamental rules of Viossa.

[LINE]
Speaker0: No translations; if it's understood, it's Viossa; and there are 4 words we are able to translate to start your journey off!

[LINE]
Speaker40: Akkurat, Nai, Fshto, Ka?
~           yes  | no | understand | what

[LINE]
Speaker0: Everything else, including vocabulary, grammar, etc., should be learned in Viossa!

[LINE]
Speaker0: If you're interested to learn more, please watch jan Misali's video on Viossa, as well as joining the Viossa discord server, where the community actively speaks/writes in it. Viossa Duolingo Stories should mainly be used as a supplement in learning Viossa!
[LINE]
Speaker0: With all that out of the way, here is some tips and tricks on how the course works.
[LINE]
Speaker0: I will be speaking in a form of Viossa that is considered "neutral" and easy to understand. Dialogues, though, will feature Viossa of different viossadjins and their natural way of speaking.

Speaker415: Un hannti na tropos f'un, au anderdžin deki hanu tropos fu hei.
~            ~ | hanu~-ti | ~ |~| fu~un| ~ | ander~-djin

[LINE]
Speaker0: Words with little gray dots underneath will show you how compound words break up as well as how affixes and words may interact. When someone uses a word that might not be immediately recognizable to everyone, a more "neutral" version may also be provided when you hover over!

[LINE]
Speaker0: Every story will also feature a variety of different questions in Viossa, so you should stay quick on your feet!
