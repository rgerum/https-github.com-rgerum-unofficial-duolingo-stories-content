> Introduction to "Urban" Shanghainese, 「上海市區閒話」

[LINE]
Speaker0: The "Urban" variety of Shanghainese (which we teach) is a Sinitic language, one of the Northern varieties under the vast Wu family of Chinese languages. 

[LINE]
Speaker592: The city has seen thousands of years of history, with archaelogical remains found from 5000 years ago. Already around the 1200s, before the Ming dynasty, the Shanghai county was established. 

[LINE]
Speaker509: 現在個上海市包括仔當時|「上海縣」以外個幾個縣。|譬如有得|「華庭縣」、|「青浦縣」、|「嘉定縣」|交「崇明縣」。
~ The~city~of~Shanghai~now~covers~what~constituted~a~few~different~counties~at~the~time, apart~from~the~then~"Shanghai~county". For~example: the~Huating~county the~Qingpu/Chinphu~county the~Jiading/Kadin~county and~the~Chongming~county.

[LINE]
Speaker509: 上海县、华庭县交青浦县呢，老早是归所谓「松江府」。|嘉定县交崇明县，是归属当时个「苏州府」。 
~ The~Shanghai,~Huating,~and~Qingpu~prefectures~belonged~to~the~so-called~"Songjiang~Prefecture". The~Jiading~and~Chongming~counties~belonged~to~the~"Suzhou~Prefecture"~at~the~time.

[LINE]
Speaker0: The various towns under these counties all had their own languages that were somewhat similar because of their geographical proximity, but still distinct from each other. 

[LINE]
Speaker418: After the city opened up its ports for foreign commerce in the mid 19th century, it has seen a massive increase in population. As the city's economy developed, people from all different Wu-speaking and non-Wu-speaking regions of China continuously flocked into the city, and brought their languages to the city. 

[LINE]
Speaker593: The presence of foreign powers and colonisation also put Shanghai in touch with a gamut of cultures, and the city-centre had become a melting pot of different languages. 

[LINE]
Speaker0: New trends and developments in language started to develop in the language due to the frequent language contact and the amount of second-language speakers in Shanghai, and gave rise to an "urbanite" mode of speech. It was distinct to the variety spoken in areas in and around the proper Shanghai county, before this quick influx of migrant population. 

[LINE]
Speaker0: However, certain speech communities (especially in less urbanised areas) tended to retain more "local" speech features and went on to develop differently to the city lect.

[LINE]
Speaker415: 現在習慣浪向，大多數人儕會得叫搿眼閒話叫：|「本地閒話」。|外加也會得稱為講本地閒話個，有上海本地祖籍個人叫：|「本地人」。
~ Customarily,~most~people~now~collectively~call~these~languages: "local~languages". People~also~call~those~who~speak~these~varieties,~and/or~who~have~ancestries~from~Shanghai~dating~back~a~few~generations: "local~people"

[LINE]
Speaker507: 上海專門研究本地閒話個一點學者，近腔也撥上海個「本地閒話」起了一隻統稱個名字叫：|「本滬話」/「本滬閒話」。
~ Some~scholars~who~study~the~"local~languages"of~Shanghai,~have~also~given~them~a~collective~term~recently: "Penwu"~(Local~Hu)~Languages/Speech.
#(we (meaning i) should reach out to 滬郊鄉音 and fact check this honestly . . .)

[LINE]
Speaker508: 阿拉搿點故事裡向，用個主要也是「市區」個閒話。|但是，經過上海開埠以來介許多年數個歷史，搿隻「市區閒話」個範圍也擴張到了市區個外頭。
~ In~our~stories,~we~still~mainly~use~the~so~called~"urban"~variety. but~

[LINE]
Speaker509: 有交關地方是有本地閒話，也有市區閒話個。|一方面末也要看搿人屋裡向，阿是講本地閒話。|但是有辰光登垃一隻家庭裡向，也會得有人講來更加像伊拉搿墶個本地閒話，|市區閒話
